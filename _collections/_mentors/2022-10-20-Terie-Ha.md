### About

I’d like to think I’m pretty outgoing and I always enjoy meeting new people and making friends! I'm always down to try new things, and I love going out on random adventures.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I remember feeling uncertain and lost in my first year of college, and my mentor was someone that helped me out a lot. Being a SASE mentee was a great experience for me, and I want to provide that for my mentee! I want to be a friend to my mentee, someone they can count on to support, advise, and just spent time with them!

### Career Goals

I'm definitely still figuring out what I want to do career-wise, and am currently exploring different fields in tech! I ultimately just want a job where I'm constantly learning and trying new things without feeling stuck in a certain place. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I generally just love spending time with people, but in my free time I enjoy doing artsy stuff like bullet journaling! I also spend way too much time on TikTok and YouTube, and I love listening to music so I'll always accept any song/artist recommendations.

### What to Expect From Me

I think the most important part of being a mentor is just to be there for my mentee whenever they need me. Whether that be with advice for classes/co-op, suggestions for places to go on campus, spontaneous adventures around the city, or just someone to talk to, I'm always down!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision our relationship to be very lighthearted and fun! Rather than having a strict mentor-mentee relationship, I want my mentee to feel comfortable coming to me as a friend for anything, whether it be personal or professional. We can talk about classes and co-op, vent about life, or just hang out and go on boba dates :)
