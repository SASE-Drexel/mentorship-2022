### About

Hiiiiiiii~ I'm just some random girl from California that loves exploring and trying new things. My goal is to be able to travel and visit a lot of new places but for now I just want to spend quality time with friends, meet more people, and continue to explore new places and share fun experiences with everyone. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

because angel forced me 

### Career Goals

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Medical robotics and aerospace used to be an interest of mine but now I just want to explore and try new things. I can tell you right now, after my last co-op, no more aerospace or aviation. Tbh I just want a stable job where I can make money and travel. 

### Co-ops

Curbside EV, Leonardo Helicopters

### Interests

I like coffee, doing work at cafes, going to concerts, hanging out with friends, music, traveling, photography, building random stuff, games.... and just learning and trying new things :)))

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to help them with whatever they need whether it be professionally, academically, or socially, really anything they need

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee to be very chill. I want to be someone that my mentee can turn to no matter what may seem to be bothering them. I just want another person that I can provide any advice to and build a friendly relationship with. We can explore, share hobbies, and try new things :)))
