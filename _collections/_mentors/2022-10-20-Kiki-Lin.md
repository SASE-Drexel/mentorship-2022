### About

Surprisingly an ESFP. I'm ambitious, selfless, cheerful, witty and hella indecisive. I stay true to my words. I'm a great listener. I'm calmer in one-on-ones but my personality shines a little more in a group. Lastly, I'm life driven. anyway, dpr we ganggang

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Firstly, I want to get to know more people. You know what they say, your network is your net worth! Secondly, I think this is a very good learning opportunity. I don't believe I was ever on the side of a mentor before, so to continue to grow as a being, I want to take on this new challenge. This is not only beneficial to me but as well as my future mentee as I can give them any insight I may have!

### Career Goals

Land a software engineer role in big tech, make lots of shmoney, then retire early :')

### Co-ops

SWE @ Lockheed Martin, SWE @ eMoney Advisor

### Interests

I enjoy grabbing food with people, chatting about life, playing games, hanging out and being active! I mainly listen to kpop, krnb, and pop/rap songs. Some basic asian girl things. I also love personal/self development and financial literacy. 

### What to Expect From Me

Ideally, I want to form a bond of trust and friendship. Hopefully, see them often and connect on a deeper level. Give them my 2 cents but since I'm not that much older, they should take it with a grain of salt, maybe a pound.
