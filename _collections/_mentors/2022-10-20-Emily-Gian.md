### About

I'm a senior doing BS/MS for MechE. I've decided to switch into project management and looking into more product management jobs. I like to embroider & other art things, gym, play different sports(tennis is my favorite), and mostly try new things out. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be there to help guide someone. Just be their friend that they can go to if they just wanted to talk or needed anything. Shed some light, some insight on how to get through college, jobs, and life. 

### Career Goals

Currently trying to find more product management based jobs for postgrad. Grow and develop more in that field, switch into more product design later on.

### Co-ops

Merck, Project Manager for Incident Response. PECO, Project Manager for Performance & Risks. SAP, Project Manager for Cyber Defense and Design

### Interests

Embroidering & anything art related. Trying out jewelry design and making right now. Tennis, badminton, gym, going on walks. Spending time w fam and friends. I want to travel a lot more.

### What to Expect From Me

I can give a combination of academics, professional, and personal guidance. I can help in any way really with academics. I can give a lot of insight on professional development based on my experiences from interviews/co-op//leaderships. I plan to really get to know my mentee and be there to give any advice/ share experiences with. Let's hang out :))

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 


I see a good friendship where I can help them in whatever way they needed. Hope to really get to know them and be someone they can go to for academic, professional, and personal advice.
