### About

I am a pretty introverted person, but once you get to know me I'm really chill and sociable! I love trying new things and eating good food. If you see me in public and I look angry, I swear that's just my face, please don't be scared of me I actually love meeting people (as long as you approach me first LOL)!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE Mentor because I want to be more involved in the club as well as meet new people. I would also like to be a resource to my mentee for anything they want to talk about.

### Career Goals

My career goals are being a data analyst or software engineer at a big tech firm.

### Co-ops

Lockheed Martin, Pfizer

### Interests

I like watching Game of Thrones, eating mozzarella sticks, and making Spotify playlists.

### What to Expect From Me

I plan on mentoring my SASE Mentee by giving career advice, telling them about classes that I have already taken, and in general just be great friends with them and make them comfortable enough to be able to ask me anything school or life related.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee to be a very positive and encouraging one. We are going to be besties for life.
