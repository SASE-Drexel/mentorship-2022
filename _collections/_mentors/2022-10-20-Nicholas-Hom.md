I am usually quiet, but if you get to know me I like to talk and learn about people's different hobbies. I enjoy trying new things and keep myself busy.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I have heard many good things about the mentorship program, and also I feel like I should since I'm on eboard and it's one of SASE's traditions

### Career Goals

I want to live comfortably while doing something I am truly passionate about, and build up a large repertoire of cool skills

### Co-ops

SRI (Stanford Research Institute)

### Interests

Videogames, volleyball, music, art

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to give them random advice and answer any questions they might have, and maybe treat them to food sometimes when I'm feeling generous

Good friends that hang out sometimes
