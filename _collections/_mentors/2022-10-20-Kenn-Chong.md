### About

Hi Kenn here, I am slightly introverted and loves spending time at my room occasionally. I do enjoy physical activities and improving myself everyday in terms of the skills, and hopefully I would be good enough to flex :)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to give back to SASE, and I feel like I have experienced SASE to a point where I can give them my experience so that they can succeed at SASE Drexel and, to a certain extent, succeed at Drexel. 

### Career Goals

Kind of go down the focus tree of SAP, and then either transition to a career within SAP where I become a software engineer or project management, or go full out into algorithmic design and AI

### Co-ops

Drexel EESI Labs, SAP

### Interests

Skiing, Ice Skating, Archery, video games, Chinese web novels, Military Science

### What to Expect From Me

Just regular hangouts during SASE events, and perhaps occasional boba runs to get to know each other more.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Just as a friend, or more as someone to elevate their views.
