### About

Heyo! I'm Nawshin and I'm a sophomore studying Finance. If you want to know the best places to eat and waste your money, I'm your gal. I am easy to talk to but I don't always feel social in big crowds. I am ambitious, funny, cool, and I love food/boba dates. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor because building friendships in the SASE community is a goal I am working towards. College can drain people and I want to be there to support someone. I participated in the mentorship event last year and I want to continue doing so. 

### Career Goals

I think I am still figuring that out, especially since I haven't had my co-op yet. However, money has always been the vision. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Fashion, valorant, anime, manga, gardening, creating content, sleeping, coffee, cat memes, and tiramisu 

### What to Expect From Me

I want my mentee to know that I will be there for them, whether it's concerning academics, personal trouble, or just silly little things. I will mentor my mentee in a friendly way. I hope to hang out with them often. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I don't want this to be just a professional relationship, I want it to be a positive friendship as well.
