### About

I would say I’m pretty chill and a down-to-earth person. I'm passionate about what I like to do and I'm goal-driven about anything I take on. I take my work seriously, but also love going out (you'll find me in Chinatown or a rave), going to the gym, and keeping myself busy with hobbies. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I've been a part of SASE since I was a freshman. I love coming back to the mentorship program to give back to the underclassmen. I hope to share my experiences, knowledge, and help others in whatever they need to navigate throughout their college journey.

### Career Goals

I want to be successful, happy, and passionate about the work I'm doing full-time, whether that be pursuing a career in technology or a passion/hobby. I also want to keep learning new skills in my field of work and keep growing as a person. 

### Co-ops

Philadelphia Streets Department, Lockheed Martin, JP Morgan Chase

### Interests

Some of my interests are playing basketball, watching the NBA (my favorite team is the Warriors), anime, gaming (osu, valorant, league), edm music, going to raves, yoyo-ing, gyming, and building custom mechanical keyboards.

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to mentor my mentee with the experience I gained from the past 4 years of college. I learned a lot throughout my undergrad and I believe my knowledge can help my mentee from a personal, academic, or professional standpoint.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision myself acting as a friend - someone you can come to if you want to hang, go out, or need advice/help.
