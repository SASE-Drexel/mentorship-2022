### About

I am a pretty chill guy that gets along with most people. When I'm not busy you can probably find me at the Korman Center. Feel free to hit me up on Discord or Instagram whenever! I definitely get enough sleep at night

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I had a lot of fun at mentorship events last year! SASE has been a pretty big part of my life since I first set foot on Drexel, and I would like to pass on my experience to other people.

### Career Goals

Computer science has always played a pretty major role in my life and I love to apply the things that I learn to new projects. My main focuses are artificial intelligence and software development, but I am also always ready to try new stuff.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

 I have a ton of hobbies and like to learn new stuff. In my free time I play a variety of different video games and also enjoy making art/music and cooking (but I can't guarantee that I'm good at any of these things)

### What to Expect From Me

Career oriented activities such as resume reviews or helping with classwork are important, but there's a lot more to Drexel than just school and work. I would like to help my mentee pursue their career goals as well as help them get used to being at Drexel.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We could hang out and do stuff often or just talk whenever they need help; I'm all for helping out in whatever way my mentee is most comfortable with
