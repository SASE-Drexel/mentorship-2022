### About

I'm a very chill and easygoing person. Open to finding new experiences in life and just trying to get through my classes at this point. I also love memes, please send.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I had a little difficulty in socializing and making connections when I started at Drexel. With SASE, I was able to make some new friends and got new experiences. I want to be able to give back to SASE and the experience I was given when I was a mentee and help others that need it.

### Career Goals

As of right now, to get a good job as a mechanical engineer in terms of more CAD and product design, as well as machining. I am very interested in this work and hope to get more experience in this.

### Co-ops

Metaphase Technologies (Test Engineer) 

### Interests

Playing video games which mainly include Destiny 2 and Genshin, listening to music, watching anime and Vtubers, and mainly sleeping.

### What to Expect From Me

Being someone that can give them advice or any general help they they may need. As well as giving them any professional advice if they want. Being a familiar face on campus  is something that I want to be to my mentee, and even as a friend if they are looking for that too.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee more as a friendship, or at the very least someone that my mentee can network with. As well as being a resource and helping out with whatever I am able to.
