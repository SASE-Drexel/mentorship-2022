### About

Hey, I'm Jiejun! you may call me JJ as well. I choose Computer Engineering because I like to tinker with computer parts. My Cantonese is like a 1st grader since I came to the US when I was 4. I enjoy talking about technology and history as well as current events (bless Wikipedia)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I was a mentee and I had a lot of fun attending the mentorship events. When I got my mentor, It turned out great and I had a lot of great experiences with them in SASE. I would like to share this experience with the newest addition of SASE members. Sharing advice on Drexel campus and professors also included ;)

### Career Goals

I want to work in both a start-up company and a FORTUNE 500 company. There are valuable experiences to be learned from both sides of the coin. I would also like to publish an academic paper. Get recognized and get rich.

### Co-ops

L3Harris Electrical Engineering

### Interests

I mainly spend my free time watching anime, reading manga, or playing PC games.

### What to Expect From Me

To make my mentee succeed academically, I would be an advisor as to which professors they should choose and the course schedule they have set up. My mentee would also receive tips on the co op process and interview process. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We would be good friends! I would just check up on them through text or social media. If they feel like asking a question, they can hit me up too!
