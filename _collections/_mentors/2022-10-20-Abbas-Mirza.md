I am always willing to learn something new and explore somewhere new. I'd consider myself an introvert but I think lately I'd like to think myself more an ambivert. Biggest cat lover you will ever meet I always carry cat food around in my bag I'll prove it.

### Career Goals

I wish to get research and development job somewhere that I can use my strengths most effectively while also maintaining a lifestyle which allows me to broaden my worldview and consistently learn more about the world and people within it. If possible working for a company with international branches.

### Co-ops

Coop 1: CPMI
Coop 2: Horiba Instruments

### Interests

Playing guitar, video games, climbing, biking, exploring the city, challenging my limits when I can, keeping up with new advancements in academia, physics, medicine, technology, etc etc, and sleeping.

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to be the best mentor ever seen on the face of the planet. Plus I'm pretty good at tutoring math and science subjects so I can help my mentee with classwork. Discovering SASE will have to be a mutual learning experience though since I also just joined

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I am honestly not entirely sure but I do believe it would be one of mutual learning and bonding, as I have a lot to learn still about philly and the world.
