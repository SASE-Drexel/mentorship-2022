about: As an introvert, I enjoy spending a lot of time in my head. I am a huge fan of fiction, whether that is movies, books, or daydreams. My love for fiction led to my affinity for literature and writing! One of my favorite things to do is plot and talk about my writing (I'm sorry to the one friend who gets to hear all about it). But while I do love my solitude, quality time with family and friends never hurt anyone. I am open to all friendships and don't mind trying new things, and I hope that with SASE I can form lasting connections!

### About

As an introvert, I enjoy spending a lot of time in my head. I am a huge fan of fiction, whether that is movies, books, or daydreams. My love for fiction led to my affinity for literature and writing! One of my favorite things to do is plot and talk about my writing (I'm sorry to the one friend who gets to hear all about it). But while I do love my solitude, quality time with family and friends never hurt anyone. I am open to all friendships and don't mind trying new things, and I hope that with SASE I can form lasting connections!

### Career Goals

I am enrolled in Drexel's FYES, and I've not a clue what to pursue in the future. However, I do enjoy psychology, reading/writing, biology, and marine biology, so any career seems pretty promising. In the end, I want to do something that matters to me. 

### Interests

My pastimes include writing/reading (I can go off on long tangents if given the chance), indulging in animes/kdramas and fangirling over pixels, and other creative activities. I am interested in psychology, the ocean and outer space, and animals in general. I also want to learn how to crochet. 

### Looking For

I believe a mentor is someone who should help me grow, academically and as an individual. I would appreciate someone who can be both a resource and a friend. I would also appreciate someone who is more outgoing and engaging than I am (I can be reserved).
