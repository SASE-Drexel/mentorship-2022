### About

I am a freshman at Drexel majoring in business while on the premed track. I’m from California and I love the beach! I also read and watch a lot of tv as well as swim.

### Career Goals

I’m still not 100% sure if I want to be a doctor or if I want to work in business. If I do want to work in business I want to work at a tech company.

### Interests

None

### Looking For

I want someone who can guide me in different areas of business or medicine and help me figure out what I want to do as a career.
