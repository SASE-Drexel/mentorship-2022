### About

I'm the type of person who likes to keep myself busy throughout most of the day, whether it be studying, hanging out with friends, or just walking around campus. In addition, I like keeping organized in what I do. I enjoy working as a team on stuff, whether it's classwork or outside of school, in addition to me being a competitive person.

### Career Goals

My main career goal is to achieve a position in the aerospace field, in addition to developing a career network and maybe grow to achieve a leadership role in a group.

### Interests

I enjoy playing volleyball and video games primarily, in addition to running and tabletop games. In addition, I like reading fantasy novels, writing and making videos. I also have a lot of interest in aviation in general.

### Looking For

For a mentor, I'm looking for someone that's easy to ask questions to, whether it be for help in classes, or planning for future courses or co-op. Also, someone that could just generally help with surviving college life would be someone I'm looking for.
