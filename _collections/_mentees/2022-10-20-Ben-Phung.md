### About

I'm quite introverted and have anxiety meeting new people. However, I am willing to improve myself. 

### Career Goals

I would like to work as a programmer at a decent tech company at least. I am interested in game development and software engineering. 

### Interests

My main interests are gaming and anime. I mostly play League of Legends but I also love From Software games such as Elden Ring and Sekiro. My favorite animes are JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Psychopass. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for help with Coop as well as how to be more involved in the Drexel community.
