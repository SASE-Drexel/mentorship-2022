### About

I am a 6'1 Asian male with glasses who is a STEM major. I like exploring the city and love trying new places to eat to look for good food. If I am not working on schoolwork, I would play games (mostly CS:GO, some Valorant, always down for Minecraft). I also like meeting new people and hanging out.  

### Career Goals

Get a degree, get a high-paying job, get money, blow money, and then repeat. Money is meant to be spent. Can't use money if you're dead.

### Interests

Playing games, exploring new places, hanging out with friends, trying new food places.

### Looking For

A friend, someone who can guide me through life like Master Shifu did to Po. Maybe like Splinter to the TMNT or Sensei Wu in Ninjago. Also looking for someone who is willing to help me if I have questions. A plus if they can carry me in Valorant because I suck in Valorant.
