### About

Hi, I'm Miya! ^_^ I use ,she/they. My name is pronounced like "Mia" but with a "ya" sound at the end. My favorite buddy is Gilbert, my (stuffed) penguin. My sleep schedule sucks so I'm tired all of the time.

### Career Goals

It would be pretty cool to find a career that could combine computer science and health.

### Interests

Nature is really beautiful, so I like to take random photos of nature. Most of my phone storage is taken up by my Photos app. I also play video games sometimes (when I'm not tired. I enjoy playing Genshin Impact, Minecraft, and Valorant (well, sometimes).

### Looking For

If there was anyone who switched from a health major to computer science, it would be cool to see if they plan on combining the two fields in some way. Other tha=n that, it would be nice to know and be friends with more people in general.
