### About

I have lived in South Philadelphia my entire life, I played basketball growing up, as of now I like to spend time hanging with friends and going to the gym

### Career Goals

I am certain I want to pursue a career in the computer science field, but I am not sure what area to concentrate on. Software engineering seems to be the most promising route. Eventually, I want to be able to understand and perform well at my job and have the option to work remotely. 

### Interests

I am interested in meeting new people, learning about their experiences, and improving on myself.

### Looking For

I am looking for some guidance in my Drexel career, whether it be what classes to choose, what field I should pay attention to, and what the environment of a job in tech is actually like.
