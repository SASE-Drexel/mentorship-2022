### About

I'm a bit introverted at first but once I'm more comfortable I can be sort of chaotic. I can be fairly fidgety when I'm nervous. When it comes to getting to know people sometimes I ask for music recommendations so I can get to know people better. Oh I also have a pretty big sweet tooth. I'm always down to get snacks : ))

### Career Goals

Currently I'm aiming to be a physician assistant. I'm not sure what specialty yet but I'm interested in pediatrics as well as maybe orthopedics or dermatology.

### Interests

I'm a huge nap enjoyer : ) When I'm not napping I like reading webtoons and a recent interest I've come across is learning how to shuffle cards. I also play some league and valorant o.o

### Looking For

I'd love someone who could help guide me in the right direction for getting to understand the healthcare field but more than that someone who can encourage me to put myself out there more. I wanna make more friends this year : )
