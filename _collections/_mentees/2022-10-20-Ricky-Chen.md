about: A Chinese-American with a pretty traditional Chinese background. I am open to try new food and activities because I am curious by nature but also I have been living under a rock for a while. I'm an eager learner by heart, and engineering is my passion. I spent my whole summer studying and tinkering with electronics while watching anime. I do self-care like skin care and fashion, but I am still working on my fashion sense.

### About

A Chinese-American with a pretty traditional Chinese background. I am open to try new food and activities because I am curious by nature but also I have been living under a rock for a while. I'm an eager learner by heart, and engineering is my passion. I spent my whole summer studying and tinkering with electronics while watching anime. I do self-care like skin care and fashion, but I am still working on my fashion sense. 

### Career Goals

Working at a company (maybe Tesla, AMD, Intel) with good pay and environment. Try to get into management and if I play my cards right, I want to start my own tech business.

### Interests

I love working out, eating and cooking food (mainly Asian and some American cuisine). I love hanging out with friends and family, either be talking or playing sports. I enjoy watching and playing basketball, and badminton and ping pong for fun.

### Looking For

In a mentor, I am looking for some professional and academic tips since I am still very new to the college and Drexel scene. I do not have the best idea of how society and companies function yet, so having a mentor to guide me would be extremely reassuring. I am also looking for just someone to talk to too, making another friend will always be a win.
