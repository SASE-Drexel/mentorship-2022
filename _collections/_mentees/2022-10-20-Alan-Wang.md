### About

If I were to describe myself I would say that I am very curious person and very interested in new things whether that would be academically or socially. I do not like a stagnant environment and enjoy the changes life throws at me.

### Career Goals

If I were to see myself in 10 years I would want my future self to have graduated with a cs degree, working in big company, living comfortably.

### Interests

None

### Looking For

What I am looking for in a mentor is going to be a combination of all three, professional, academic, and personal aspect. The wisdom and experience that the mentors have would be invaluable information especially to a freshman like me who is new to everything.
