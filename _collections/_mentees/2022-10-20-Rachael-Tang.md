### About

I'm a very introverted person but once you're able to get to know me a bit better I do lots of random things and I'm more outgoing. 

### Career Goals

I like the aspects of what a UX designer has and does so I'll like to achieve those skills that it has to take. I also like to make money.

### Interests

I'm very obsessed with Harry Potter and all of its sorts. I also enjoy playing FPS games in my free time.

### Looking For

I really like friends, I like smart people that can answer all my questions(because I have a lot of questions), and someone I can talk to and relate to.
