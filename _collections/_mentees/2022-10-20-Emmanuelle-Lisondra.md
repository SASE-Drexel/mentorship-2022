about: I'm Emmanuelle (they/them), but you could either call me Em or Noelle for short! I'm an international student from the Philippines, so a lot of the American Experience(tm) is still new to me.

Not sure what else to add here, so have some fun facts: I have 7 dogs back home, my Hogwarts house is Ravenclaw (I've actually never seen Harry Potter), and my MBTI is XNFP (the introvert/extrovert result changes every time I take it).
year: Freshman
major: Biomedical Engineering

### About

I'm Emmanuelle (they/them), but you could either call me Em or Noelle for short! I'm an international student from the Philippines, so a lot of the American Experience(tm) is still new to me.

Not sure what else to add here, so have some fun facts: I have 7 dogs back home, my Hogwarts house is Ravenclaw (I've actually never seen Harry Potter), and my MBTI is XNFP (the introvert/extrovert result changes every time I take it).

### Career Goals

As I'm a freshman, my goals could change as I gain more exposure in the fields I'm interested in. For now, I hope to contribute to the scientific community through innovations in biomedical devices, in terms of both software and hardware.

### Interests

Outside of academics, I spend most of my time watching TV shows, playing video games, drawing, and writing. I like to explore, so name any hobby (...except sports, maybe) and I've probably tried it at least once!

### Looking For

I'm not quite sure what exactly I'd expect from a mentor, but for the most part I think it's essentially having an older sibling on campus â€” someone who'll check in from time to time, answer any questions I might have about opportunities at Drexel, or even someone who'll point me to the best food spots around the city.
