### About

I'm pretty reliable and easygoing. I like meeting new people although I'm a bit of an introvert. I would say I'm hardworking but I do get unmotivated easily.

### Career Goals

At this point I don't really have it planned out, but I do want to work for a large tech company 

### Interests

I like being around people and talking to my friends. I play some video games: League, DBD, Overwatch, other multiplayer games. I also like reading both novels and webtoons/manga

### Looking For

I'm looking for a well-rounded mentor. Someone I can rely on for academic/professional advice but also easygoing as a person.
