### About

Hi! My name is Marcela. I am a Philadelphia Native! I went to Central High School (281). I'm Indonesian/Chinese and I'm turning 19 in October. I love listening to music, baking, reading, and skating! I tend to be more on the shy and quiet side at first, but after getting comfortable, I'll be more open. 

### Career Goals

In the future, I hope to be somewhere with working in creating something more on the creative side. Recently I enjoyed working with websites, but I also haven't explored much yet! I just hope to be working in tech.

### Interests

I can speak around 5 languages and I play 3 instruments. Something pretty cool about me is that I currently work as an Ice Skater/skate guard. I tend to try and keep myself busy, so I like to try new hobbies or fill my free time with doing something! 

### Looking For

I hope to have someone that I can go to for help academically as well as personally. College has been a hard shift for me from high school, so I'm hoping to be able to open up to my mentor.
