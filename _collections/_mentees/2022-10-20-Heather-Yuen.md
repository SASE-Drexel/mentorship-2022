about: Contrary to popular belief, I am not scary and I do touch grass! I would say that I am pretty quiet, and shy, but I do open up as I get to know you more. I’m a sophomore studying computer science, and you’ll probably find me stressing over school work quite often. Other than school, I can probably be found listening to music. Once my head fully heals from my trip to the ER (literally the second day I was on campus this year), you can probably find me playing tennis again!

### About

Contrary to popular belief, I am not scary and I do touch grass! I would say that I am pretty quiet, and shy, but I do open up as I get to know you more. I’m a sophomore studying computer science, and you’ll probably find me stressing over school work quite often. Other than school, I can probably be found listening to music. Once my head fully heals from my trip to the ER (literally the second day I was on campus this year), you can probably find me playing tennis again!

### Career Goals

Currently, I’m not sure where I’d like to go with my computer science degree yet. I like office settings, and I’m looking to use each coop to explore a different sized company. I hope that each company has a different setting so I can figure out my preferences.

### Interests

I really enjoy playing and watching tennis. I also like listening to music, and that’s what most people associate me with. Unlike many people, I think art museums are cool, and I like seeing nice scenery. I also think it is important to find good places for food! 

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor that can help guide me professionally and academically, but I do not want to be able to be good friends with my mentor. Regarding the professional aspect, I hope that my mentor can help guide me to choose the right path of CS for me, whether that be software engineering or security. I think that it would be super cool to find out which professors should be avoided, and I think that these basics could be a starting point to our friendship!
