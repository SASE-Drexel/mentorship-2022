### About

Hi everyone! I’m Shannon a freshman majoring in BME. My ethnicity is Taiwanese and I’m from suburban Philly. I’m a huge foodie so please let me know if anyone has recommendations! I love listening to all kinds of music and watching dramas. My MBTI is ESFJ and I’m always open to making new friends :)

### Career Goals

I am in the BS/MD program at Drexel so I hope to successfully matriculate at the end of my four years for undergrad. As of now I hope to become a psychiatrist or pediatrician.

### Interests

I love watching kdramas and cdramas and I also love cooking (although that’s been hard in college). I also like exploring the city at night and just hanging out with friends. I’m a casual genshin and aov player too!

### Looking For

I’m looking for someone who can help me academically but also just someone to be friends with!
