about: I'm a sophomore majoring in CS. A hobby I enjoy is baking! I've baked custdard pudding, breads, and buns. Generally, I read a lot of manhwa and webnovels (I've even developed a spreadsheet). Some games I play are Genshin and Minecraft. Music wise, I listen to many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean songs. Overall, I am rather reserved and take some time to warm up to people. However, I most definitely want to meet new people and make new friends.

### About

I'm a sophomore majoring in CS. A hobby I enjoy is baking! I've baked custdard pudding, breads, and buns. Generally, I read a lot of manhwa and webnovels (I've even developed a spreadsheet). Some games I play are Genshin and Minecraft. Music wise, I listen to many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean songs. Overall, I am rather reserved and take some time to warm up to people. However, I most definitely want to meet new people and make new friends. 

### Career Goals

My career goals are not very defined at the moment, but if I could, I want to go into an industry that combines both programming and medicine. Preferably something like biotechology. 

### Interests

My interests include biology, baking, gaming, and listening to true crime. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor who'll be able to provide me with both academic and professional advice possibly regarding to comp sci or something similar. Some guidance would be great to learn what I might to look for in courses/jobs or how to better perform during interviews. Personally, I want to also learn from the mentor how they managed their time at Drexel.
