### About

Hello I am Keith Truongcao! As has already been said on this form, I am an ECE, electrical is my bachelor's and computer engineering is my master's degree. I have an interest in combining hardware and software together with machine learning and making projects and robots that can help people who need them. I also very much enjoy talking to people and I love learning a lot of things that are outside of school (college stinks :/). I like watching anime, reading manga, and playing video games..... like a typical engineering student. 

### Career Goals

I do have an interest in working for big tech and honestly I will not lie I want to make a lot of money. But I feel that I can make money and pursue my passion for making different technologies that can help a lot of people. I honestly do not mind which company I work for as long as I make a good impact, like the projects I am working for and get compensated well enough. 

### Interests

I already did say that I liked watching anime, reading manga, and playing video games, but I also like researching stocks and understanding finance, as I have a general interest in economics and business but I also find that they are very important things to know. 

### Looking For

I am mainly looking for someone who can give me good professional and personal advice, academic advice would be great as well. I want someone who can encourage me when I should have the confidence to do something and also them to give me very realistic advice when I need to get my stuff together.
