### About

Hello. I am a first-year student majoring computer science. Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, playing video games, soccer, and cooking. I am usually self-reserved and tend to keep to myself, but I usually open myself up better after we talk and get to know each other. 

### Career Goals

I would like to learn how to work in a professional environment. I would also like to learn how to apply my co-op experience and skills for my future career. 

### Interests

None

### Looking For

I would like to have a mentor to help me with my academic and personal problems, and I would also like to seek various kinds of advice. I would like to also know my mentor outside of being a mentor and more as a friend.
