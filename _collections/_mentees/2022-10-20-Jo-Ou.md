about: I would like to state I never actually thought that deeply about how I would describe myself till now. So, this going to be fascinating for both me and whoever reading this. I would first describe myself being artistic since I often doodle on the side of my notebook when taking notes in class. In other cases, I may consider myself too determined even when the odds are stacked against me. So, I would say I am pretty tolerable with humiliating defeats, but I still continue to hype up myself that one day I will see glory.

### About

I would like to state I never actually thought that deeply about how I would describe myself till now. So, this going to be fascinating for both me and whoever reading this. I would first describe myself being artistic since I often doodle on the side of my notebook when taking notes in class. In other cases, I may consider myself too determined even when the odds are stacked against me. So, I would say I am pretty tolerable with humiliating defeats, but I still continue to hype up myself that one day I will see glory.

### Career Goals

But I am tied between becoming a language teacher(likely the Japanese language) or/and security engineer. 

### Interests

I enjoy playing badminton and running. When I am not physically moving, I enjoy solving CTFs challenges, working on coding projects, or/and gaming. I mostly play Destiny 2 Minecraft.

### Looking For

A mentor who can provide me with guidance in time management. I am also hoping to find a mentor who I can become friends with and who has similar career goals and interests as myself. It would be nice to talk about something we both are passionate about.
