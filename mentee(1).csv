I'm a little scared about this, since I have been ""out"" for less than a month. It can be a bit stressful to even introduce myself. However, my family does not know I have a preferred name so it's a bit weird to have it and my photo on a public website. It also doesn't help that I'm a commuter so I'm not really sure how the events above will line up with when it's possible for me to be on campus that late. I do want to try something like this, but I don't want to 100% say I can participate. I may need to withdraw, if that's 100% okay."

As has already been said on this form, I am an ECE, electrical is my bachelor's and computer engineering is my master's degree. I have an interest in combining hardware and software together with machine learning and making projects and robots that can help people who need them. I also very much enjoy talking to people and I love learning a lot of things that are outside of school (college stinks :/). I like watching anime, reading manga, and playing video games..... like a typical engineering student. ","I do have an interest in working for big tech and honestly I will not lie I want to make a lot of money. But I feel that I can make money and pursue my passion for making different technologies that can help a lot of people. I honestly do not mind which company I work for as long as I make a good impact, like the projects I am working for and get compensated well enough. ","I already did say that I liked watching anime, reading manga, and playing video games, but I also like researching stocks and understanding finance, as I have a general interest in economics and business but I also find that they are very important things to know. ","I am mainly looking for someone who can give me good professional and personal advice, academic advice would be great as well. I want someone who can encourage me when I should have the confidence to do something and also them to give me very realistic advice when I need to get my stuff together.
