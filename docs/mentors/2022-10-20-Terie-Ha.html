  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm pretty outgoing and I always enjoy meeting new people and making friends! I‚Äôm always down to try new things, and I love going out on random adventures.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I remember feeling uncertain and lost in my first year of college, and my mentor was someone that helped me out a lot. Being a SASE mentee was a great experience for me, and I want to provide that for my mentee! I want to be a friend to my mentee, someone they can count on to support, advise, and just spent time with them!</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm definitely still figuring out what I want to do career-wise, and am currently exploring different fields in tech! I ultimately just want a job where I‚Äôm constantly learning and trying new things without feeling stuck in a certain place.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I generally just love spending time with people, but in my free time I enjoy doing artsy stuff like bullet journaling! I also spend way too much time on TikTok and YouTube, and I love listening to music so I‚Äôll always accept any song/artist recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I think the most important part of being a mentor is just to be there for my mentee whenever they need me. Whether that be with advice for classes/co-op, suggestions for places to go on campus, spontaneous adventures around the city, or just someone to talk to, I‚Äôm always down!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision our relationship to be very lighthearted and fun! Rather than having a strict mentor-mentee relationship, I want my mentee to feel comfortable coming to me as a friend for anything, whether it be personal or professional. We can talk about classes and co-op, vent about life, or just hang out and go on boba dates :)</p>
