  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hey guys!! So today, we are introducing the Jacky Huang! I am from New Jersey so been in the Philly area for a bit of my life. I am curious about many things in life and am always down for nearly anything. Additionally, I love to travel! I also love learning about different languages and cultures. You might catch me at random places throughout campus, so don‚Äôt hesitate to say ‚ÄúAyo?‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I decided to be a SASE Mentor because I want to make my last year at Drexel a more impactful one. What better way to do so than to leave a legacy through this mentorship program. Being a mentor also allows me to find a lifelong friend.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>For the near future, I plan to search for a software development position. However, I am interested in branching into other fields as well. Nonetheless, I want to find a career in which I can be flexible with my time. For now, I still am pretty much going with the flow. :3</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Lockheed Martin, eMoney Advisor</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Videogames, Traveling, Rock-Climbing, Photography, Biking, Dancing, FOOOD, Music: Kpop, Pop, K-R&amp;B</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I plan to provide them advice on all that one needs to survive the adverse conditions of Drexel. I will help them professionally for co-op, tutor as needed academically, and show them how to enjoy Drexel to the fullest.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I am looking for a mentee that will be my lifelong friend and one where both of us can learn from the other. As always, we will strive to have a combination of professional, academic, and interpersonal relationships.</p>
